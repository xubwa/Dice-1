### Running Tests

There are two sets of tests, the smaller set (`./runSmallTests.sh`) which can run on small computers (or laptops).
The second set (`./runTests.sh`) should be run on hardware with a fair amount of memory.

Both scripts have a variable `MPICOMMAND`, make sure that you set the number of proccessors here very carefully or the tests could take a painfully long time.

```
MPICOMMAND="mpirun -np 28"
```

Executing the tests:

```bash
$ ./runTests.sh
